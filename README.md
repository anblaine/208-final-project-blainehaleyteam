# Image Compression using ICA+KMeans
Members: Alex Blaine, David Haley

We'll be demonstrating how Independent Component Analysis and KMeans Clustering can be used together to compress images.
Additionally, we'll evaluate how ICA's tolerance and KMeans number of cluster centers affects the performance of the method.
